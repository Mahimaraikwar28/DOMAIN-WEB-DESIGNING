 __INPUT: TO DESIGN A BASIC WEB PAGE,USING HTML's BASIC TAGS.

 ### LOGIC OR EXPLANATION OF CODE:
 
 * The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
 * The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.
 * The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
 * The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
 * The <h1> element defines a large heading.
 * The <p> element defines a paragraph.
